## Licensing
The license for each part of the project is shown in its "licensetype.txt" file. This file will contain either "Hardware" or "Software". Hardware indicates the files you have downloaded are licensed under the hardware category, and Software indicates they are licensed under the Software category. The relevant licenses are shown below, as well as in the license file of the download. The licensetype.txt also will give the names and 

### Hardware (CERN-OHL-W V2)
Licensing is placed on the silkscreen of each PCB designed. This **cannot** be removed, even if you make a derivative work. You may add other accreditations, but it must be clear that your work originates from here. Example accreditation is shown below

## Project Aims
Unlike other homebrew computers, I wanted mine to assemble like a real computer - plugging in a RAM card, placing a CPU into a socket and then inserting peripherals, before providing power from a commonly used source (my first motherboard design uses a DC barrel jack). I also wanted to be able to use other common protocols - ideally, CPUs will be able to use PS/2 keyboards and UART communication. I'm hoping in the future they will to be able to host USB 1.1 or 2.0, probably for USB keyboards and USB flash drives

## Sub-categories
  -**ThunderEclipse**: CPUs for the project
  -**VISION**: GPUs for the project
  -**Peripheral Bus Interface** - Most recent update: version 1.0. Parallel bus protocol the CPUs use to output data to peripherals. 3V3 operating voltage
